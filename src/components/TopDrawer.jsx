            One player sets a trick by doing a particular skateboarding trick of
            their choice. If the trick is not landed, another player attempts to
            set a trick. Once a trick has been set (landed), the other player(s)
            must respond by doing the same trick in their first try. If they
            make it the game continues; If every one gets the trick the player
            who set it gets a point if they miss it, they get a letter, starting
            with S, and so on, until they have missed five tricks, spelling
            SKATE, and they are out or the game is over. No trick may be set
            more than once in the same game and a skater defending on their last
            letter may receive two attempts at that trick. If the player lands
            the trick they have gained the lead and set the trick.
